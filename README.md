## Description

A simple desktop calculator created with C#. I created this project to practice working with classes, objects, and methods. Which is why I seperated the project code into GUI (<a href="https://github.com/jrliv/Calculator/blob/master/Calculator/MainWindow.xaml.cs" target="_blank">MainWindow.xaml.cs</a>) and calculation (<a href="https://github.com/jrliv/Calculator/blob/master/Calculator/Calculate.cs" target="_blank">Calculate.cs</a>) logic parts.

##	Usage

Feel free to do whatever you want with this project. I'm not planning on changing or updating it so I included the executable file. If you're using Windows and you just want to run and play with it you can download and run <a href="https://github.com/jrliv/Calculator/blob/master/Calculator/bin/Debug/Calculator.exe" target="_blank">the executable</a>.
